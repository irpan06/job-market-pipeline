# Job Market Data Pipeline

## Project Overview  
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **data engineering workflow** designed to collect, process, and prepare job market data for analytical use. The pipeline extracts job listings from public sources, cleans and standardizes the information, and structures it using the **medallion architecture** (Bronze–Silver–Gold).  

The primary goal is to build a scalable and automated data foundation that can power downstream analytics and dashboards, enabling insights such as hiring trends, skill demands, and salary distributions across locations.

## Objectives  
The project focuses on three key objectives:  
1. **Data Collection Automation** – Build a scraping pipeline to fetch the latest job postings from multiple sources.  
2. **Data Transformation and Quality Management** – Implement cleaning and standardization processes to ensure reliable data for analysis.  
3. **Modular Architecture Design** – Apply the medallion architecture pattern to simulate real-world data lakehouse workflows.  

Through this project, I aim to showcase practical skills in data ingestion, transformation, orchestration, and architecture design—all core components of a modern data engineering role.

## Workflow and Architecture  
The pipeline follows a modular flow inspired by the medallion architecture:  

- **Bronze Layer** – Raw job data ingested from web sources and stored in its original form.  
- **Silver Layer** – Cleaned, structured, and standardized data ready for analytical modeling.  
- **Gold Layer** – Aggregated and enriched datasets used by the analytical dashboard for reporting and visualization.  

The orchestration layer manages scheduled scraping, transformation, and storage updates. The pipeline is designed to be easily extended with additional data sources or cloud integration in future iterations.

## Technology Stack  
The implementation uses a combination of open-source technologies and modern data engineering practices, including:  

- **Python** – Core scripting for data scraping and transformation.  
- **BeautifulSoup / Requests** – For extracting job listings from web sources.  
- **Pandas / PyArrow** – For data cleaning, transformation, and Parquet optimization.  
- **Prefect** – For orchestration and task scheduling.  
- **DuckDB / Local Storage** – For lightweight data lake simulation.  

This stack was chosen to balance reproducibility, cost efficiency, and scalability—making it suitable for a personal project while still aligning with production-level design principles.

## Future Improvements  
Planned enhancements for upcoming versions include:  
- Integration with cloud-based storage and orchestration (e.g., AWS S3, Prefect Cloud).  
- Expansion to multiple job listing platforms to increase data coverage.  
- Incremental updates and data versioning for change tracking.  
- Real-time data serving via API endpoints for the analytics dashboard.  

These improvements will evolve the project toward a fully cloud-native data ecosystem while maintaining its educational and portfolio-friendly design.
